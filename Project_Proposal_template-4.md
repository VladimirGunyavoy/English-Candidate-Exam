## Content Requirements

The Proposal should contain a concise, clear and true representation of a research topic. It does not necessarily have to be your PhD Thesis research; it could be your research for a conference, publication or even a seminar. It can be a completed project or work in progress.

You may choose to present the experimental or the practical part of your work, to educate the audience on how to conduct the experiment, or design a product. It is preferable to have some reportable results; however, if there are no results yet, you can talk about the expected results and their intended significance.

The necessary condition is that it is your independent and individual research (if it is a part of group project, your individual role should be highlighted, and your personal results should be the focus of the Proposal.)

The Proposal should include the main structural elements: introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. Familiarize yourselves with the materials below to refresh the information on abstract writing.
