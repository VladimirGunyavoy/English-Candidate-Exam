# English Candidate Examination as a Multidisciplinary Conference

## Project Preparation and Presentation

The **Exam** is designed as a multidisciplinary Conference with the structure and stages mimicking conference participation procedure.

The duration is **ONE FULL TERM**. The online Pre-conference stage takes place during the weeks 1-6. The offline (in person) Exam Conference takes place during the last week of the term. The exact date is communicated by the Education Department.

During the **Pre-conference stage** (online, weeks 1-6), the participants prepare a Project (an extended Abstract), a Video-abstract (a 2-min self-video), and a Stack of slides for a 7-min Final Presentation according to the specified criteria.

All materials are Peer-Reviewed.

All materials are Graded by the Instructor.

Next, Participants use the comments of their Reviewers and the Instructor to improve the materials and upload the Final versions of each assignment.

Finally (week 7), a multidisciplinary conference is held in the presence of all Course Participants and the Examination Committee comprising the language Instructors and the Faculty representing relevant disciplines.

During the **Exam (Conference)**, each PhD student makes a presentation (7 minutes) based on his/her research area of interest followed by a discussion.

The presenter is expected to demonstrate a variety of academic skills:

- Planning and designing a well-structured and balanced presentation
- Formulating and negotiating the research ideas through the process of writing and peer editing
- Communicating research-related ideas to a multi-disciplinary audience
- Presentation skills
- Discussion skills (the ability to tackle a variety of questions from the audience)

The aim is primarily to **communicate** specific research across the multidisciplinary boundaries, to **inform** and to **instruct** the participants.

## Deliverables

### BEFORE THE EXAM (ONLINE) Graded Assignments

> **Please note that failure to upload the required material by the due date is automatically graded as FAIL and further submissions will be denied.**

1. **Project Proposal** is a concise summary of the project, including the Background, Objectives, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion (**650 words**), and the List of References in IEEE format. In other words, the text should be 650 words, plus a List of 3-10 references in IEEE.

The proposal should describe the general theme and scope of the research and presentation. The theme may be stated as a problem to be investigated, an issue to be explored, or an argument to be defended. The proposal might indicate where the student is starting out and where s/he would like to get in terms of answering a question, exploring a phenomenon, understanding a theory, building a skill or other goal. It should articulate the theme and strategy of the study as clearly as possible within 650 words.

- Choose a **topic** within your broad area of research interest.

You may choose to present the experimental or the practical part of your work, to educate the audience on how to conduct the experiment, or design a product. It is preferable to have some reportable results; however, if there are no results yet, you can talk about the expected results and their intended significance.

- All references in the text and the list of references should be submitted in **IEEE format**.
- There should be NO VISUAL elements (graphs, figures, tables, etc)
- AI assistance in writing the proposal is strongly discouraged.

The **TEMPLATE** for the Proposal can be found in **FILES**.

Complete instructions are provided in each assignment.

2. **Peer Review**.

> You will be requested to peer review two Proposals submitted by your classmates and provide clear recommendations for improvement following the template. You will also be required to peer review one video and one stack of presentation slides.

The **Guidelines** to assess the quality of a proposal, text assessment **criteria**, and presentation **grading** criteria can be found below and also in **FILES**. Complete instructions are provided in each assignment.

3. **Self-video.**

You will be requested to make a 2-minute video overview of the proposed presentation. The goal is to describe **verbally** the scope and results of the Project and the intended approach to their presentation. The video should be without slides, and the presenter's face should be clearly visible. The presenter should not be reading from the screen. Rather, they should be talking to the audience, maintaining eye-contact and using appropriate body language.

The technicalities should be scaled appropriately to fit the needs of a multidisciplinary audience.

You will be expected to Peer review one video produced by your colleague.

Complete instructions are provided in each assignment.

4. **Presentation Slides.**

> You will be expected to upload the slides for the 7-min presentation and Peer review one stack of slides produced by your colleague.

Complete instructions are provided in each assignment.

5. **Final versions of all assignments.**

> You will be expected to incorporate changes suggested by your Reviewers and the Instructor and upload the final versions of all assignments.

### AT THE EXAM (OFFLINE CONFERENCE)

6. **Final Presentation and discussion**

> You are expected to make a presentation (7 minutes) and take part in the discussion and Question and answer session after the presentation.

**To encourage active listening,** participants will be expected to provide written comments about each presentation. The comments will be collected and summarized by the Instructor along with the Committee comments for the Final Grade.

Participants will vote for the Best Presenter. The Best Presenter will get **an extra (bonus) score** to be added to the final grade.

## Grading Criteria

**The Grades for the Pre-conference assignments make up 50 % of the Final Grade.**

**The Exam (Conference) Presentation makes up 50% of the Final Grade.**

**The TOTAL Grade is made up of the Pre-Conference Grade and the Presentation Grade.**
